# haste
A virtual fm synthesizer made with IPlug2

## Short Summary:
Haste is a sound designer's fm synth; it gives the designer control over every wave and how they combine. Haste has no bars, so if you get too complicated Haste may slow to a halt. (Use a smaller sample rate for testing.)

## Features:
- Create wave-blocks and connect them together to modulate frequencies however you want!
- Combine wave-blocks to make more complicated signals.
- Isolate the characters of a certain wave at a certain band using filters unique to each wave-block.
- Randomize your wave-blocks or generate random wave-block configurations based on templates.
- [possible?] Features a learning algorthm to approximate arbitrary samples out of FM algorithms (synth patch).
